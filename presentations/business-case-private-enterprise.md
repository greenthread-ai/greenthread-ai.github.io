**GreenThread for Private Enterprise**

*AI That Stays In-House*

## Slide 2: The Data Sovereignty Problem

**Every API call to external AI sends your data outside your control**

When you use OpenAI, Bedrock, or Azure AI:
- Customer records flow to third-party servers
- Proprietary code and trade secrets leave your boundary
- Financial data transits external networks
- Compliance becomes a moving target

**Your data is your competitive advantage. Why give it away?**

---

## Slide 3: The Hidden Costs of External AI

**Beyond the per-token charges**

| Risk Category | Business Impact |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Data exposure | IP theft, competitive disadvantage |
| Compliance gaps | Regulatory fines, audit failures |
| Vendor lock-in | Pricing increases, feature dependency |
| Latency | Poor user experience, limited use cases |

**The cheapest inference is the one that doesn't put your data at risk.**

---

## Slide 4: The GreenThread Solution

**Run AI on your infrastructure, with your data, under your control**

GreenThread is a distributed AI inference platform that:
- Deploys on your existing GPU infrastructure
- Keeps all data within your security boundary
- Supports air-gapped and fully offline operation
- Delivers enterprise-grade AI without third-party dependency

**Result:** Full AI capability with zero data exposure.

---

## Slide 5: Complete Data Sovereignty

**Your data never leaves. Ever.**

| External AI Services | GreenThread |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Data leaves your network | Data stays inside |
| Third-party data processing | Your infrastructure only |
| Shared compute resources | Dedicated to your organization |
| Internet dependency | Air-gapped capable |

**Architecture:** Your Data + Your Models + Your GPUs = Complete Control

---

## Slide 6: Unified ML Platform

**One platform for your entire AI workflow**

| Capability | When | Benefit |
|------------|------|---------|
| Production inference | 24/7 | Serve AI to applications |
| Fine-tuning | Off-peak | Customize models on your data |
| Training | Overnight | Build proprietary models |

**No more juggling separate tools.** Same GPUs, same platform, all workloads.

---

## Slide 7: Maximize GPU Investment

**Enterprise GPUs are expensive. Make them earn their keep.**

| Metric | Industry Average | With GreenThread |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| GPU utilization | 30-40% | 85%+ |
| Models per GPU | 1 | 15+ |
| Workload types | Single | Inference + Training |

**A single H100 costs $30,000+.** At 30% utilization, you're wasting $21,000 of value.

---

## Slide 8: The Technology Advantage

**Model Multiplexing eliminates GPU waste**

How it works:
- Multiple models share GPU resources dynamically
- <5ms context switching between models
- Intelligent scheduling based on demand patterns
- Zero-copy memory management

**Result:** 2.5x more workloads per GPU, 60% infrastructure cost reduction.

---

## Slide 9: Hybrid Training

**Inference by day. Training by night.**

Typical 24-hour GPU utilization with GreenThread:

| Time | Primary Workload | Utilization |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| 6am-6pm | Production inference | 90%+ |
| 6pm-12am | Inference + Fine-tuning | 85%+ |
| 12am-6am | Training jobs | 95%+ |

**92% average utilization** vs. 35% industry average.

## Slide 10: Enterprise-Grade Security

**Built to meet the most demanding requirements**

Certifications (completed or in progress):
- ISO 27001:2022 - Information security management
- ISO 42001:2023 - AI management systems
- SOC 1 & 2 Type 2 - Security and availability
- HITRUST - Healthcare data protection
- PCI-DSS 4.0 - Payment card security

**Australian-built** to the highest global standards.

---

## Slide 11: Team-Ready Features

**Safe for shared enterprise environments**

Built-in capabilities:
- Multi-tenant isolation between teams/departments
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Per-team quotas and resource allocation
- Complete audit trails for every request
- Guardrails and content policies

**Let every team use AI without risking security.**

---

## Slide 12: Integration & Compatibility

**Works with your existing tools**

- **APIs:** OpenAI-compatible (drop-in replacement)
- **Models:** HuggingFace integration, custom model support
- **Deployment:** Kubernetes-native, Terraform support
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus metrics, standard logging
- **Infrastructure:** Cloud, on-prem, edge, or hybrid

**No vendor lock-in. No proprietary formats.**

---

## Slide 13: ROI Summary

**The financial case for bringing AI in-house**

| Investment Area | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| Infrastructure costs | 60% reduction through higher utilization |
| External AI spend | Eliminated for covered use cases |
| Risk reduction | No data exposure, full compliance |
| Capability expansion | Run models external AI won't allow |
| Time to value | New models deployed in minutes |

---

## Slide 14: Implementation Approach

**Phased deployment minimizes risk**

1. **Assessment** - Review infrastructure, requirements, and use cases
2. **Pilot** - Deploy on subset of GPUs with selected models
3. **Validation** - Prove performance, security, and integration
4. **Rollout** - Expand across organization
5. **Optimization** - Continuous improvement and model expansion

**Deployment support included.** We succeed when you succeed.
