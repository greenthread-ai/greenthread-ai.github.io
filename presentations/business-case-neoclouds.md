# GreenThread for NeoClouds
## Business Case Presentation

## Slide 1: Title
**GreenThread for NeoClouds**

*Turn Idle GPUs into a Revenue-Generating AI Platform*

[GreenThread Logo]

---

## Slide 2: The Opportunity

**Your customers don't want GPUs. They want AI.**

- The market is shifting from "rent compute" to "use AI"
- Hyperscalers (AWS Bedrock, Azure AI, Google Vertex) are capturing this value
- NeoClouds have the hardware but lack the platform to compete

**The question:** How do you capture this value before it's too late?

---

## Slide 3: The Hidden Cost of Idle Capacity

**60% of your GPU fleet is producing zero revenue**

| Metric | Current State |
|--------|---------------|
| Average GPU utilization | 30-40% |
| Idle capacity | 60-70% |
| Revenue from idle GPUs | $0 |

Every hour a GPU sits idle is money left on the table.

---

## Slide 4: The GreenThread Solution

**Transform idle compute into inference-as-a-service revenue**

GreenThread is a distributed AI inference platform that:

- Runs on your existing GPU infrastructure
- Enables shared inference services on unused capacity
- Provides a turnkey AI platform rivaling hyperscalers

**Result:** New revenue stream with zero additional hardware investment.

---

## Slide 5: The Technology Advantage

**Model Multiplexing: The core innovation**

| Traditional Approach | With GreenThread |
|---------------------|------------------|
| 1 GPU = 1 model | 1 GPU = 50+ models |
| 15-30% utilization | 85%+ utilization |
| Minutes to switch models | <5ms model switching |
| 8 GPUs = 8 models | 8 GPUs = 200+ models |

Serve your entire model catalog from a fraction of the hardware.

---

## Slide 6: New Business Model

**From "Rent This GPU" to "Use This AI"**

| Old Model | New Model |
|-----------|-----------|
| Sell raw GPU hours | Sell AI inference |
| Customer manages everything | You manage infrastructure |
| Commodity pricing pressure | Value-based pricing |
| Limited differentiation | Massive model catalog |

Your customers get AI results. You get higher margins.

---

## Slide 7: Competitive Positioning

**Compete with the hyperscalers on model availability, not just price**

What you can offer with GreenThread:
- More models than AWS Bedrock or Azure AI
- Instant model deployment (minutes, not weeks)
- Same OpenAI-compatible APIs enterprises already use
- Lower latency from regional proximity

**Differentiation:** Hyperscalers can't match your local presence and responsiveness.

---

## Slide 8: Revenue Impact

**3x revenue potential from the same hardware**

Example: 100-GPU fleet

| Scenario | Utilization | Revenue Potential |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Current (dedicated only) | 35% | Baseline |
| With shared inference | 85% | 2.4x baseline |
| + Premium model access | 85%+ | 3x+ baseline |

**Key insight:** You're already paying for these GPUs. GreenThread unlocks their full value.

---

## Slide 9: Enterprise-Ready from Day One

**Win enterprise deals with security-first infrastructure**

Built-in capabilities:
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Guardrails and compliance controls
- Complete audit trails
- Role-based access control

Certifications: ISO 27001, ISO 42001, SOC 2 Type 2, HITRUST, PCI-DSS 4.0

---

## Slide 10: Implementation

**Go-to-market in weeks, not months**

1. **Deploy** - GreenThread installs on your existing infrastructure
2. **Configure** - Set up model catalog and pricing tiers
3. **Launch** - OpenAI-compatible API endpoints for customers
4. **Scale** - Add models instantly as demand grows

No rip-and-replace. Works alongside your existing dedicated compute business.

---

## Slide 11: Why Now?

**The AI inference market is exploding**

- Enterprise AI adoption accelerating rapidly
- Hyperscalers are capturing the inference-as-a-service market
- First-mover advantage matters: customers are choosing platforms now
- Your GPUs are depreciating while they sit idle

**Window of opportunity:** Establish your AI platform before the market consolidates.

---

## Slide 12: Customer Success Metrics

**What success looks like**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| GPU utilization | 85%+ (from ~35%) |
| Models offered | 100-200+ |
| New revenue stream | Significant % of compute revenue |
| Time to first revenue | Weeks from deployment |

---

## Slide 13: Partnership Model

**How we work together**

- **Licensing:** Platform license based on GPU fleet size
- **Support:** 24/7 technical support and customer success
